# Camunda History Reporting
This project illustrates usage of composite DB history handler to import all relevant data into reporting data 
store without affecting default Camunda history data.

Reporting is based on to-do activites and approach of fetching to-do activities is much faster when using custom tables
where you have all data that you need.

## Setting project up
- Create database with name `cam-history` (use schema.sql file on project root)
- Navigate to project directory and type `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
- Run project
